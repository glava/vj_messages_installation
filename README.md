VJ messages Installation
========================

VJ messages installation is project completed for "Kišobran birthday week" exibition. As a part of Kišobran organization I was asked from VJ team to develop a simple animated message board. 

Messages are moving in three different lanes with the speed that can be configured. User can interact with board in two ways: entering message using keyboard or posting tweet with hashtag #kisobran. VJs latter used this application as an input and mapped it on nine separated whiteboards. 

The premier of installation took place on December 18. in Dom Omladine.
